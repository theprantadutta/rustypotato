## Migration Guide

### From Redis
RustyPotato is designed as a drop-in replacement for Redis for basic operations:

1. **Compatible Commands**: SET, GET, DEL, EXISTS, EXPIRE, TTL, INCR, DECR
2. **Protocol**: Full RESP protocol support
3. **Clients**: Use existing Redis client libraries
4. **Tools**: redis-cli and redis-benchmark work out of the box

### Configuration Migration
```bash
# Redis configuration
port 6379
save 900 1

# RustyPotato equivalent
[server]
port = 6379

[storage]
aof_enabled = true
aof_fsync = "everysec"
```

### Data Migration
```bash
# Export from Redis
redis-cli --rdb dump.rdb

# Import to RustyPotato (planned feature)
rustypotato-cli import dump.rdb
```
